# Shipping_Data_ML
Exploration and ML with shipping dataset from Kaggle. I have always been interested in logistics and how things get from point A to point B. I figured I would explore a lttle more of that with this dataset.

I utilize EDA with pandas along with numpy data transformations in order to prep my data. I modeled it using a random forest classifier as I believed it would handle the dimensionality of the data well. This project was a nice exercise in working with categorical and continuous data points.
